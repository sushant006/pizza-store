# React + Vite
This is something I tried while learning react, This is a static home page of a pizza store which I have made using some basic functionalities of react such as components, props, passing props from parent to child component, using ternary opertors, array map method is also used to create a number of components using  only 3 to 4 lines of code.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
